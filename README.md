## Features & Overview

- **Portable**: one repo to sync configuration across all your machines  
- **Templated / data-driven**: support for machine-specific logic via `dotfiles` templating  
- **Script hooks**: scripts under `.chezmoiscripts` execute automatically during `chezmoi apply`  
- **Bootstrap logic**: run an initial setup via `dot_bootstrap`  
- **IDE support**: includes a list of VSCode extensions to keep editors in sync  
- Clean separation of config, data, and scripts

## Structure & Directory Description

Hereâ€™s a brief description of key directories and files:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.chezmoidata/` | Data files (YAML, JSON, etc.) used by templates for conditional configuration |
| `.chezmoiscripts/` | Hook scripts (e.g. `run_*.sh`) that run when applying configuration |
| `dot_bootstrap/` | Scripts or logic for first-time machine setup |
| `dot_config/` | Configuration files (e.g. `~/.config/*`) maintained under version control |
| `dot_zshrc` | Your `~/.zshrc` or Zsh-related configuration |
| `vscode-extensions.txt` | List of VSCode extensions to install or sync |

> **Note:** chezmoi interprets names with `dot_` or similar conventions and creates appropriate symlinks into your home directory (or target paths).
